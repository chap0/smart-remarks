# smart-remarks
Smart Remarks is a simple script that scrapes comments out of HTML.  When providing a single URL or list of URLs, this script will search for the HTML comment tags e.g. "<!-- Comment here -->" and print the comments to the console.

For now it was a simple python project to get my feet wet with python but in the future I would like to update this script so it will take command line arguments vs prompt input.
